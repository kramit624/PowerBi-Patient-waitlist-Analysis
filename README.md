## 🏥 Patient Waitlist Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

The Patient Waitlist Analysis project focuses on analyzing hospital Emergency Room (ER) data to understand patient wait-time patterns and service efficiency. By examining demographic and operational factors such as age group, patient race, appointment type, department, and visit timing, this project aims to identify bottlenecks and highlight opportunities to improve patient experience and hospital operations.

This analysis is presented through an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to quickly interpret trends and make data-driven decisions.
